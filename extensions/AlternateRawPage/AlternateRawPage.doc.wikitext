== Purpose==
Provides another means of extracting articles in 'raw' format.

== Motivation ==
Sometimes it is not practical to construct a url with the 'action=raw' parameter because the said url must then have its parameters delimited using the ''&'' character.

== Usage ==
Build an url for the article in question and append '/raw' to the end of the article's title.

== Example ==
To retrieve the page ''TestPage'' in ''raw'' format, just build the url ''TestPage/raw''.

== Dependancy ==
None.
