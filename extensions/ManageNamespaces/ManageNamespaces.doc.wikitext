== Purpose ==
This extension allows for managing the namespaces. This process is usually handled through settings <code>LocalSettings.php</code>.

== Features ==
* No patches
* Secure: the registry page is located in NS_MEDIAWIKI namespace
* Safe: the 'immutable' namespaces can not be changed (the ones defined in <code>LocalSettings.php</code>)
** Only the ones managed through this extension can be changed
* Relies on a parser function <code>#mns</code> to perform the work
* Definition errors appear inline with the registry page
* Logging

== Usage ==
* Edit the page <code>MediaWiki:Registry/Namespaces</code>
* Use the parser function <code>#mns</code> to populate the namespace definition
* Save the page

== Example ==
An example registry page can be found [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}/Example]]

== Dependancy ==
* [[Extension:StubManager|StubManager extension]]

{{Pear|ManageNamespaces}}

== Notes ==
* Make sure that the extension's directory is readable by the HTTP server
* Make sure that the file 'ManageNamespaces.namespaces.php' is readable & writable by the HTTP server

== History ==
=== 1.0.1 ===
