== Purpose==
This extension provides viewing pages in the language specified by the user's preferences automatically.

== Features ==
* Based language is assumed to be 'en'
* Base 'page' (i.e. no /$lang sub-page) is assumed to be in 'en' language
* Parser Cache Friendly

== Usage ==
* Visit 'page' and redirection to 'page/$lang' will be effected IF $lang != 'en'
* 'page/en' can be visited as per normal
* Visit 'page/' to show 'page' without any redirection based on this extension
  (i.e. same as visiting 'page' )

== Dependency ==
* [[Extension:StubManager]]

{{Pear|AutoLanguage}}

== Notes ==
This extension is heavily based on the 'Polyglot' extension found on Mediawiki.org.

== History ==
* Removed dependency on ExtensionClass
