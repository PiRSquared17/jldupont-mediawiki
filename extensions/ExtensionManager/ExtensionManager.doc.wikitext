== Purpose==
Provides a means of easily installing 'extensions' to MediaWiki.

== Features ==
* Once installed, other extensions retrieved through Jean-Lou Dupont's PEAR channel do not have
to be explicitly added to <code>LocalSettings.php</code>

== Theory of Operation ==

== Usage ==
* Use real caching e.g. PHP/pecl APC
** Else, the extension directories will be rescanned on each request

== Dependancy ==
* [[Extension:StubManager|StubManager extension]]

== Installation ==
* First, install [[Extension:StubManager]] extension.
* Second, there are two ways to install this extension:
# Through the 'pear' installer (preferred method)
# Through downloading the archive

=== Method: pear ===
<code>pear install mediawiki/ExtensionManager</code>
 The latest [[Extension:StubManager]] implements an automatic discovery of [[Extension:ExtensionManager]]
 so no further steps are required.
