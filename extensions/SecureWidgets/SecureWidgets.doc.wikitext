== Purpose==
Provides secure inclusion of ''widgets''

== Features ==
* Performance: widget code is cached (in the ''transcache'' database table)
* ''Batteries included'': no need to copy code from other pages to get widgets: they are readily available through a repository
* Extensible: new widgets can be created by editing pages in the ''Widget'' namespace
** The list is available [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}#Widget_List]]
* Secure: Widgets are controlled  through a ''read-only'' SVN repository
** For locally administered widgets in the ''Widget'' namespace, the appropriate access-control must be put in place manually

== Usage ==
<nowiki>{{#widget:widget-name|optional-parameters}}</nowiki>

== Example ==
<!-- The following is only available where the extension is installed -->
{{#widget:Gliffy|id=1422053}}

== Widget List ==
The list of available widgets is available as an [http://feeds.feedburner.com/jldupont/mw-widgets RSS feed]. The widget name can be inferred by the entry title; e.g.:
 Widget:Gliffy - version 1.0.0
thus the widget name would be ''Gliffy'' and one could use it through <nowiki>{{#widget:Gliffy ...}}</nowiki>

== Widget Namespace ==
One can use [[Extension:ManageNamespaces]] to add and manage the ''Widget'' namespace. This is entirely optional.

== Dependencies ==
* [[Extension:ExtensionManager]] of version >= 2.0.1
** Automatically resolved if using PEAR
