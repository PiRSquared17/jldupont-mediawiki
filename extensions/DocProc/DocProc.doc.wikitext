== Purpose==
Serves to document markup/magic words whilst still executing them as per required.

== Features ==
* Documents all wikitext types by enclosing the said wikitext in either 'code' or 'pre' tags
* Executes the passed wikitext as per usual processing flow
* Secure: only predefined HTML documentation tags can be specified
** Currently, only the 'pre' and 'code' tags are supported

== Usage ==
Let's say one wants to document & still execute the following wikitext:
:<docproc tag=code>{{CURRENTTIME}}</docproc>
:Here the wikitext magic word ''CURRENTTIME'' would be executed and the result would be presented next to the 'documented' 
wikitext enclosed inside a 'code' section.

== Target Application ==
The envisaged target application for this extension is to document wikitext that produces no direct user visible results.
