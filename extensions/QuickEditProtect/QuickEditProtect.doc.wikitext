== Purpose==
Provides an AJAX shortcut to edit protect/un-protect a page. The usual way (through the ''protect/unprotect'' form) is still provided.

== Features ==
* AJAX controlled for performace
* Secure: respects permissions (usually members of the ''sysop'' group have the ''protect'' right) 

== Installation of Javascript file ==
The file ''QuickEditProtect.js'' is provided in the tarball distribution and should be included in the wiki's [[Mediawiki:Common.js]] page. The reason to include the javascript code directly in Common.js relates to performance: the less separate JS files, the better.

== Dependency ==
* [[Extension:ExtensionManager]] of version >= 2.0.1
** Automatically resolved if using PEAR
