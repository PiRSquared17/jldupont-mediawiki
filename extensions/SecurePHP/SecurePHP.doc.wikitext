== Purpose==
Provides secure execution of PHP code embedded in 'runphp' tagged section.

== Features ==
* Security: page must either
** Be protected on 'edit'
** Current user editing the page must have the 'coding' right
** Or, lastly, the last contributor to the page has the 'coding' right

== Usage ==
<nowiki><runphp> php code here </runphp></nowiki>

== Security Note ==
* It is advisable to use 'cascading protection'
* When page protection is not relied on to provide protection 
and consequently only the last contributor's right acts as protection measure, it is advised to use
considerable care when using templates on the same page.

== Dependancy ==
* [[Extension:StubManager|StubManager extension]]
** Automatically resolved if using PEAR

{{Pear|SecurePHP}}

== History ==
* Moved to MediaWiki on GoogleCode project
* Standardized entry point; now, always SecurePHP.php whatever installation method.
