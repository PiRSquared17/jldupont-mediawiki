== Purpose ==
Provides replication functionality to Amazon S3.

== Features ==
* Replicates page changes to an Amazon S3 bucket
* Queuing upon target replication bucket unavailability
** ''Lag'' reporting

== Usage ==
=== Configuration of the Amazon S3 bucket ===

== Theory Of Operation ==
This extension uses the services of [[Extension:Backup]] to replicate each page change to an Amazon S3 bucket.

=== Amazon S3 bucket offline condition ===
When the target replication bucket cannot be used (i.e. offline, unreachable etc.), then a local 'job' is inserted
in the queue. 

=== Out of Order execution ===
When the replication target is available, the changes are replicated 'in order' i.e.
in sequence with the 'recentchanges_save' hook events. When the replication target
isn't available, then the 'job' process handling ''may'' cause out-of-order execution.
The net effect of this condition is only really perceptible when the [[Extension:RestoreS3]]
is running currently on a replication partner machine.
