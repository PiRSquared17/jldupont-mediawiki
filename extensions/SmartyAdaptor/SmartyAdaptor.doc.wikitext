== Purpose ==
Provides integration with [http://smarty.net/ Smarty Template Engine] by providing a ''hook'' to other extensions.

== Features ==
* ''Hook'' based for easy integration
* Debug information available on [[Special:Version]]

== Configuration Notes ==
Two directories must be accessible and '''writable''' by PHP / WEB Server:
* ''$IP/smarty/cache'' 
* ''$IP/smarty/compile''
Where $IP is the global PHP variable denoting MediaWiki's installation path. E.g. ''/var/www/html/wiki''

On Linux, one must use, as example, <pre>chown apache cache</pre> to make the directory writable for the owner ''apache''.

== Hook ''smarty'' ==
Other extensions use [[Extension:SmartyAdaptor]] for their templating needs through the ''hook'' '''smarty'''.

=== Calling Method ===
<pre>wfRunHooks( 'smarty', $name, $tpl, $params, $result );</pre>
* $name: name of template; only useful when other extensions want to insert themselves in the chain
* $tpl: absolute path to the template file
* $params: array of parameters. E.g. array( 'var1' => 'value1' ... )
* $result: result
