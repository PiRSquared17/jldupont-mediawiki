Provides a means of easily installing 'extensions' to MediaWiki. Once installed, other extensions retrieved through Jean-Lou Dupont's PEAR channel do not have to be explicitly added to <code>LocalSettings.php</code>

== Dependency ==
* [optional] PEAR::Validate

{{Pear|ExtensionManager}}

== Functional Notes ==
* Use real caching e.g. PHP/pecl APC
** Else, the extension directories will be rescanned on each request (i.e. much slower)

== For Extension Developers ==
An example file ''Example.php'' is made available in the installation tarball / PEAR package.

== History ==
