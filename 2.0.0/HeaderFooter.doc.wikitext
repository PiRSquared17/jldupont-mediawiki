 *  1) Suggestion from a user:
 *     // Look for the header and footer in the Template: namespace
 *     $name = "Template:".($ns==0 ? "Main" : Namespace::getCanonicalName($ns))."/".$name;
 *
 * HISTORY:
 * -- Version 1.1:	added support for <noheader/> and <nofooter/>
 * -- Version 1.11: changed interface to ArticleCacheClass: using singleton
 * -- Version 1.12: added check to ensure that the process is only performed once
 *                  i.e. the article requested in the transaction (and not other
 *                  articles fetched during the rendering process)
 *                  (helps with some other extensions that do fetch multiple pages
 *                   before returning the final render requested page).
 * -- Version 1.13: - Added support for '__NOHEADER__' and '__NOFOOTER__' magic words         
 * -- Version 1.14: - Added support for better parser cache integration
 *                    i.e. the normal MW behavior is to save an updated/created article
 *                    in the parser cache BEFORE this extension has the chance to execute.
 *                    This extension update disables this behavior but don't worry, the article will
 *                    be saved by MW the next time the article is viewed. 
 * -- Version 1.15: - Integration with 'ParserCacheControl' extension.
 * -- Version 1.16: - Added missing 'return true' in function handler.
 *                  - Added check for 'ParserCacheControl' in hook creation.
