== Purpose==
This extension is meant to address 'rare events' handling through class object 'stubs'. For infrequent events 
(of course this is relative!), use this extension to instantiate a 'stub object' for the required hooks.
The net effect is lower transaction times thereby speeding up MediaWiki based sites.

== Features ==
* Handles 'hook' registration
* Handles 'parser function' registration
* Handles 'parser magic word' registration
* Handles 'parser tag' registration
* Handles extensions which implement logging functionality
* Handles 'namespace triggering': reduces even further the load time per transaction

== Audience ==
This extension is meant for 'extension writers'.

== Usage ==
To create a stub, use: 
<source lang=php>
StubManager::createStub(  'class name', 
                          'full path filename of class file',
                          'full path filename of i18n file',						  
                          array of hooks,
						  $logging, // true if the extension requires logging support
                          array of tags,
                          array of parser function magic words,
                          array of parser magic words,
						  array of namespaces that trigger the extension
                        );
</source>
in <code>LocalSettings.php</code> after the require line <code>require( ...'StubManager.php' );</code>
