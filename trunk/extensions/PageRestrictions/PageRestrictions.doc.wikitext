== Purpose==
Adds page level restrictions. The setting of these restrictions is granted to a user with the 'protect' right.

== Features ==

== Notes ==
* Currently, the only 'right' enforced directly by this extension is 'read'. From an implementation point of view, 
a request comes in with either 'action=view' or no 'action' field. This must be translated to 'read'; this function
occurs centrally in 'HierarchicalNamespacePermissions' extension.

== Dependancy ==
