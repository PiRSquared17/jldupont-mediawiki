== Features ==
* Once installed, other extensions retrieved through Jean-Lou Dupont's PEAR channel do not have
to be explicitly added to <code>LocalSettings.php</code>

== Theory of Operation ==

== Usage ==
* Use real caching e.g. PHP/pecl APC
** Else, the extension directories will be rescanned on each request
