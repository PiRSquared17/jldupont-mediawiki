== Purpose==
This extension offers the ability to process posted pages/forms through the 'action=formsubmit' action. 
The processing code resides in the database. The code can be 'syntax highlighted' through a 
<nowiki><php></nowiki> tag.

== Features ==
* Handles 'action=formsubmit' action
* Follows 'redirects'
* Executes PHP code stored in a standard Mediawiki page
* Supports code extraction when enclosed in 'PHP' tags
* Supports the definition of a class in the processor page ( $page.'Class' )
** If a method 'submit' is present in the said class, it will be called upon formsubmit action (see example)

== Example ==
=== Form Processing Page 'MyFormProc' ===
<pre> <!-- remove pre section -->
<php>
  class MyFormProcClass
  {
  	 function submit() { implement your handler here }
  }
</php>
</pre>
== Dependancies ==
* [[Extension:StubManager]] extension
* [[Extension:RunPHP Class]] extension

{{Pear|FormProc}}

== History ==
* added functionality to define a class for handling form processing
* removed dependency on ExtensionClass
* added stubbing capability through StubManager
