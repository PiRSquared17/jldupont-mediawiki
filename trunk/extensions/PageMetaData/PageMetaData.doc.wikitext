== Purpose ==
Provides saving pages' metadata (i.e. restrictions) to a wikitext page.
This extension is especially useful in situation where XML database dumping is used in place of a complete MySQL database backup.

== Features ==
* Page metadata stored in 'Page_Namespace:Page.meta'

== IMPORTANT PRIVACY NOTE ==
This extension *can* expose confidential information if not used with an appropriate permission management sub-system such as [[Extension:HNP]].
Of course, the said sub-system must also be properly configured to restrict access to all pages following the pattern '~.meta'.

== Dependencies ==
* [[Extension:StubManager|StubManager extension]]
* Optional but highly recommended [[Extension:HNP]]

{{Pear|PageMetaData}}
