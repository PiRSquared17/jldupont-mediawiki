== Purpose ==
Provides versatile PHP class autoloading.

== Features ==
* Flexible: multiple class locations 
* Secure: classes retrieved through the database must be in the ''Code'' namespace and be ''edit protected''
* Extensible: the static method ''add'' can be used to register additional autoloaders

== Theory Of Operation ==
When a class is required (e.g. [[Extension:FlowProcessor]]) for processing, the following options are available:
* do a ''require/include'' statement with the path to the class file
* rely on PHP's autoloading feature
This extension taps itself on the latter on provides flexible class loading by searching (in priority):
* The extra autoloaders registered through the extension's ''add'' static method
* The PEAR directory under '''MediaWiki/Classes/$class.php'''
* The MediaWiki installation ''extensions'' directory i.e. '''$IP/extensions/Classes/$class.php'''
* The MediaWiki page database under the namespace ''Code'' i.e. '''Code:$class'''

== Usage ==
