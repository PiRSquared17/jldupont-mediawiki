Purpose:  This extension is about adding the support for 'SuperGroups' to Mediawiki. 

What are 'SuperGroups' ?
------------------------
Mediawiki currently supports one way of 'grouping' users: user groups. There are only a 
few groups defined by default:
1) '*' group:    default group for all users (anonymous)
2) 'user' group: default group for all logged in users
3) 'sysop' group
4) 'bureaucrat' group

The SuperGroups feature is about supporting 'closed user groups' i.e. group of users having 
their own Namespaces set.
