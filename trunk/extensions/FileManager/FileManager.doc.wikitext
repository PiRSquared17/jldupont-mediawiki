== Purpose ==
This Mediawiki extension enables a user with the 'commitfile' right to edit files in the Mediawiki installation directory.  

== Features ==
* Can be used independantly of BizzWiki environment 
* New rights: 'readfile', 'commitfile'
* Logging
* New Namespace 'NS_FILESYSTEM'
* Support for titles beginning with small caps; need the title to be prefixed with '/'
** e.g. to have access to 'includes/Setup.php' just reference the title 'Filesystem:/includes/Setup.php'
* No auto summary upon page creation

== DEPENDANCY ==
* [[Extension:StubManager]]

== Notes ==
It is recommended to use:
<source lang=php>
$wgCapitalLinks = false;
</source>
in <code>LocalSettings.php</code>; default MediaWiki behavior is to capitalize title names which
does not help with filesystem behavior on certain operating systems.

=== NS_FILESYSTEM namespace ===
The namespace with for identifier <code>NS_FILESYSTEM</code> must be created in <code>LocalSettings.php</code>

=== Usage ===
Visit a page on corresponding with a file located in the MediaWiki installation directory. E.g.
 Filesystem:/includes/Article.php

== History ==
* fixed for 'wgCapitalLinks' 
* fixed for suppressing PHP error messages on file_get_contents
* fixed logging messages
* disabled 'auto summary' upon page creation (clogs recentchanges, logs etc.)
* added 'reload' functionality
* Added some protection against !isset indexes in '$wgExtensionCredits'
* Added 'proprietary words' functionality
** @@file@@   replaces for the current filename
** @@mtime@@  replaces for the current filename last modification timestamp
** @@currentmtime@@ replaces for the current extracted filename last modification timestamp
* Removed extraneous '/' in the path name
* Added 'parser phase 2' magic words:
** ( ($#extractfile|@@file@@$) )   : extracts the filename returned through the proprietary word '@@file@@'
** ( ($#extractmtime|@@mtime@@$) ) : extracts 'mtime' returned through the proprietary word '@@mtime@@'
* EditFormPreload: added check for title both 'underscored' and not 

== TODO ==
* internationalization
* add 'edit from filesystem' functionality: capability to 'reload' a file from the filesystem
* enhance 'logging' through $type etc.
