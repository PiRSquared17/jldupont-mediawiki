== Purpose==
Provides secure inclusion of ''widgets''

== Features ==
* ''Batteries included'': no need to copy code from other pages to access the widgets: they are readily available through a repository
** The list is available [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}#Widget_List]]
* Security:  

== Usage ==
<nowiki>{{#widget:widget-name|optional-parameters}}</nowiki>

== Example ==
<!-- The following is only available where the extension is installed -->
{{#widget:Gliffy|id=1422053}}

== Widget List ==
The list of available widgets is available as an [http://feeds.feedburner.com/jldupont/mw-widgets RSS feed]. The widget name can be inferred by the entry title; e.g.:
 Widget:Gliffy - version 1.0.0
thus the widget name would be ''Gliffy'' and one could use it through <nowiki>{{#widget:Gliffy ...}}</nowiki>

== Dependencies ==
* [[Extension:ExtensionManager]] of version >= 2.0.1
** Automatically resolved if using PEAR

{{Pear|SecureWidgets}}
