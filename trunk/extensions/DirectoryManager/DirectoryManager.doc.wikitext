== Purpose==
Provides a namespace 'Directory' for browsing the filesystem of a MediaWiki installation.

== Features ==
* Directory tree structure roots on MediaWiki installation
* Security: enforcement of the 'read' right
* Integrates with [[Extension:FileManager]]
* Highly customizable through 'hooks'

== Dependancy ==
* [[Extension:StubManager|StubManager extension]]

== Usage Notes ==
It is recommended to use:
<source lang=php>
$wgCapitalLinks = false;
</source>
in <code>LocalSettings.php</code>; default MediaWiki behavior is to capitalize title names which
does not help with filesystem behavior on certain operating systems.

{{Pear|DirectoryManager}}

== History ==
* Fix for empty $files list
* Fix for capital letter annoyance
* Added '#directory' magic word
* Added 'green' anchors for directories
